    Replication of existing research is often referred to as one of the cornerstones of modern science. In this article, we test whether the publication of independent replication attempts affects the citation patterns of underlying studies. Investigating 95 replications conducted in the context of the Reproducibility Project: Psychology, our analyses analyses provide little evidence for an adjustment of citation patterns in response to the publication of these independent replication attempts. This finding is robust to the choice of replication criterion, various model specifications, and the composition of the contrast group. We further present some suggestive evidence that shifts in the underlying composition of supporting and disputing citations have likely been small. We conclude with a review of the evidence in favor of the remaining explanations and discuss the potential consequences of our findings for the workings of the scientific process.

    <p>
    Supplementary hands-on instruction in small groups - so called tutorials - represents an integral feature of many courses in higher education. In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, some higher education institutions have allowed tutorials to continue in person whereas lectures have mostly been moved online. In this study, we exploit features of the introduction of a hybrid teaching scheme at a Swedish higher education institution to test whether the administration of online tutorials led to a deterioration in students' learning outcomes. Leveraging within-student variation in test scores, we find no evidence for a reduction in learning outcomes across modes of teaching. Our estimates thus suggest that even the most hands-on aspects of instruction can successfully be transferred online without sacrificing student learning.

    Seeding in tournaments is a process of creating a schedule based on performance in the recent past. It is used in many athletic disciplines to ensure that particularly attractive match ups do not occur until the later stages of the tournament. We exploit the discontinuous nature of the seeding system in the UEFA Champions League and the UEFA Europa League as a natural experiment to estimate the causal effect of being seeded. We find no evidence that seeding itself contributes positively to the team's success in the tournament. This finding is surprising given the substantial drop in average strength of the opponents for seeded teams and in striking opposition to the findings of previous studies.

[Do Political Protests Mobilize Voters? Evidence from the Black Lives Matter Protests](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1p2s5lYlzqUbzRaKfRK-6PrPugDD6UUvT/view?usp=sharing), (co-author: [Oliver Engist](https://sites.google.com/view/oliverengist/home))<br/>

    <p>
    In this article, we study the local political mobilization effects of political protests in the context of the Black Lives Matter movement. We analyze monthly voter registration data from 2136 US counties across 32 states in a generalized difference-in-differences design. Our main results show that counties that experienced a BLM protest did not see an increase in voter registrations. Furthermore, we find no evidence that the effect differs across voters that register as Democrats or Republicans, but we can rule out meaningful reductions in the voter registrations for both major parties. We hypothesise that the scope of the protest and the extensive news coverage have reduced the importance of experiencing a protest first-hand.
