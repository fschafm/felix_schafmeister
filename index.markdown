**Welcome!**

I am a PhD candidate in Economics at the [Stockholm School of Economics](https://www.hhs.se/en/research/departments/de/). 

My research interests lie primarily in the economics of education and political economics, but I have also ventured into research on the topics of meta-science, gender economics, as well as sports economics.

I believe in the importance of open science practices to improve the reliability of academic research. For this reason, whenever possible, I have pre-registered research protocols on the [OSF](https://osf.io/gmyfc/).

See the Research tab for more information on my work.
