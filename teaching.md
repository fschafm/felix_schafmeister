At the Stockholm School of Economics, I have been involved in teaching a variety of courses, starting as a teaching assistant and more recently acting as joint course director. 

Below you find a brief overview of my teaching experience. Materials and teaching evaluations are available upon request.

        4-ECTS elective on the Master's level, open to various specializations.  The course aims at introducing students to data analysis techniques in R,    relying to a large extent on the packages introduced in the context of the     *tidyverse*. Specific topics covered include an introduction to base R,     data manipulation using the tidyverse, iteration, functions, web-scraping,  project management, data analysis and visualization, and an introduction     to machine learning.

        7.5-ECTS elective on the Master's level. Given as part of the economics specialization, but open to students from other fields. The course provides a broad overview of recent research in gender economics. Topics covered include statistical issues in modern research, as well as theoretical and empirical research on discrimination and stereotyping, family formation, social norms, and preferences. <br/>
        My lectures focused on biases in evaluation and promotions, as well as stereotyping. I further designed and led 3 tutorials focusing on statistical issues in empirical research in gender economics.
